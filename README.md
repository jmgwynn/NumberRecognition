# NumberRecognition
Number Recognition Artificial Neural Net Project

This is an Artificial Neural Net for reading hand-written numbers. The training and test files were provided by Dr. Michael Franklin,
and the optdigits_names file contains info on how the digits were processed.

The highest accuracy I ever got with the current Learning Rate was 93%, and can be seen in epoch 16 in results.png

Accuracy obtained when running this code on your own may differ, as it is dependent on the random initialization of weights and balances,
as well as how the order inputs are fed into the net is shuffled.
